# MATLAB-Implementation-of-Pure_Pursuit-and-Vector-Field-Histogram-

In this project, Robotics simulation toolbox in MATLAB was used to implement path following of a turtlebot in presence of obstacles from a start to goal location. The path following task was achieved by implementing **PURE PURSUIT** and obstacle avoidance was achived by implementing **VECTOR FIELD HISTOGRAM (VFH)**.
